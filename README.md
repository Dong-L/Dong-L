Welcome to my page! My name is Duncan. I'm a software engineer who enjoys learning and improving as much as accomplishing goals, if not more.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a productivity app that helps you organize your time and your tasks in a unique and addicting way. Keeping it vague for now to maintain the surprise.

ðŸŽˆFun Fact: My username is a play on my Korean name, Dong, and the word "dongle". Because I like to form connections, of course.

You can find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan-g-lee/. Happy coding!
